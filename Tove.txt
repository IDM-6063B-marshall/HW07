P.S. How lovely to get your letter! I carry it with me everywhere.   
Yes, Iâ€™d like to sit on the hill at Brunsan and get a cold backside and a red nose and eat an awkward orange that makes a mess of my gloves and step in a deep puddle and then go home to our balls of fluff and tumble into your arms and fall asleep with my whole head full of spring!  
I love you!
